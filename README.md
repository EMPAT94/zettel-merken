# Intro

Zettel stands for "note" and Merken stands for "remember" in German. Literal translation would imply "Remember your notes", but that is an overly simplistic definition of what the title stands for.

To be precise, zettel merken is a fusion of two impactful ideas in the field of knowledge management and learning enhancement: "Zettelkasten" and "Spaced Repetition".
